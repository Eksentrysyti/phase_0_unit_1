    <h2>Why Pair Programming?</h2>
    <img class="pairprogramming" src="http://pairprogrammingisfun.com/images/header.jpg">
    <p>Pair programming is a useful concept in that it helps programmers solve coding problems.  
        It allows you to let someone else look at your work, bounce ideas, and check for errors as they code.
        In addition, it also provides soft skill benefits as it allows each coder to learn from each others'
        styles, attitudes, problem solving thought process, and technical abilities.  It also trains each person
        in their communication skills. It is also important because when you are pairing with somebody, and if he/she uses different
        productvity tools to make programming tool easier and faster, and if you like it you

    <h2>Difference between driver and navigator</h2>
    <p>Drivers: Takes instruction from the navigator and writes the code down.  For example, if the navigator
    says that we should change the color of a page header to red, the driver would add that stylistic change to the
    CSS. Navigator:- Navigator is somebody who basically throws ideas about how to proceed. For example, if 
        two people are trying to design a html page, and are about write css for the html, navigator is somebody
        who would give driver idea like, making font 18px, or making image circular...

    <h2>Reflect your pair programming experience</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Puru's Reflection:-</strong>
 
    Although this is not my first pair programming, but it defenitely was my first with Steven. I am loving it so far. We got chance to know each other, each other's methods of learning and coding.

    <p><strong>Steven's reflection: -</strong> Pair programming is a new experience for me, and I found it enjoyable and relaxing
    in that we could work together and have another person to collaborate and fill in the blanks in our knowledge.
    I felt a lot more pressure in having to know everything while programming solo.  I think we had great team chemistry and didn't have issues completing the challenge.
