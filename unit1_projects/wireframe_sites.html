	<h2>
		Site 1: www.Batoto.com
	</h2>
	<p>This website's objective is to organize collections of Japanese comics (manga) and be able to present them to the user as they want to read them.  It must be able to receive updates from contributors, save bookmarked series that each user wants to read, and have a searchable database.  A challenge this site faces is trying to keep the layout simple yet functional.  At times it can seem cluttered, yet there is not enough room to fit all the information the site thinks its readers might need.</p>

	<h2>
		Site 2: www.google.com
	</h2>
	<p>The goal of this website (that most people are familiar with by now) is to allow people to search for something on the Internet.  Unlike many other search sites, there is no frilly content to advertise anything aside from that it is a search page by Google.  There are minimal challenges this site faces, it is about as clean and simple as a website can be.</p>

	<h2>
		Site 3: www.newegg.com
	</h2>
	<p>The goal of this website is to provide a customers an interface from which they can view products from manufacturers and make purchases.  It features many special deals as well as regular stock and tries to appeal to buyers to make a purchase.  A challenge this site faces is that there is very limited space for the number of products they would like to showcase.  To try to advertise as many items as they can, the site resorts to using scrolling advertisements to increase exposure.</p>
