# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

- Web standards are nice in that without too much extra CSS work, a website can be different and yet familiar to a new user.  This can help user experience by reducing the time it takes for a user to figure out what is going in a site.  For example.  By default, links are blue when unvisited and turn purple when visited.  A new user who has been to a few sites can immediately adapt to a new page that uses the same standard, whereas they may need a moment to figure out what the colors mean if they were set differently.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

- The standard structure makes sense to me as it provides a near optimal set of rules for any website that is comfortable to users and fits most websites well.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

 - I like the new HTML5 elements.  Most websites can be broken down into the sections that the HTML5 elements define.  It helps development of a new site by allowing programmers to code quicker and organize each section intuitively for later revisions.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

 - A reset.css is necessary in that allows you to create uniformity and consistency of a web page over different browsers.  By removing formatting and reducing it to the baseline content and then applying your own CSS, you can make the page look the same.  I think of it as taking a piece of old wooden furniture, removing the old finish, and redo-ing the finish.  One does not simply put a new coat on, they have to strip off the old coat to gain consistency in the new coat.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

 - I usually use Firefox and Chrome.  There have been a few times where I've noticed subtle differences on a site between the two browsers.  Usually the differences have to do with the style of a an interactive feature, the placement of certain elements, and the slightly differences in font formatting (though it could have been a browser setting issue.).  I don't think allowing a site to look different between browsers is a good thing in that the site experience is no longer uniform.  Different people may get a different experience and it is harder to troubleshoot issues on the site if it appears differently between browsers.

 * Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

 - I found this website to help look for new HTML5 elements.  I liked it in that it allowed you to play with each element in a sandbox.
