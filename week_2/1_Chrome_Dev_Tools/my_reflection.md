# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a convention that allows different platforms and languages to interact with each other in web documents.  It allows representation and interaction between objects without requiring the use of specific languages.  It makes sense in that it is like an interpreter that can bridge the differences between differing languages so that they can work together.  What doesn't make sense to me is that if the DOM can do this, why must there be so many different languages that you would need the DOM in the first place, and what would be the advantage of it?

- At this point, there are a lot more resources loaded into a wordpress blog than there are in mine.  While the main blog html and css files are similar in size, the wordpress site had a lot more extras such as banners, headers, links to other pages, and a few requests for files not found.

- Chrome Web Tools is rather fun and interesting.  I like tweaking things to improve them, and having this tool can take the frustration out of trying to improve or debug a website.

- The "aha" moment was almost every step of learning how to use Web Tools, as I figured out each of the functions in Web Tools and how to use them to analyze and improve a website.
