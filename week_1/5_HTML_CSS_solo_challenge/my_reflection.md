A lot of time spent in this challenge was trying to figure out how to tweak positioning (and figuring out the difference between absolute and relative positioning).  The tutorial was extremely vague and I needed to google various other guides to see examples on how positioning would be done.

I'm still not comfortable with positioning and will need to spend extra time understanding the concepts.  I will also need a tremendous amount more practice with working with divs.  I get confused with nesting other elements within a div and sometimes need to review older parts of code to figure out how to add everything I want to add within a div.

One trick I find that helps me is to carefully name ids, classes, and order items in the CSS file in a way that mirrors the ordering in the html.  If my html file had header, sidebar, content, and footer divs, then my CSS would name each ID in the same way and in the same order they appeared.

I'm fairly confident in using HTML tags (just a matter of practice and memorizing the more common tags), but have no confidence in positioning items with the box model.

I liked creating divs, text content, images, and links in this challenge.

I found positioning extremely tedious.  A lot of the work was trial and error.  It would be tremendously faster to design a site using a graphical interface instead of trying to describe where an element is to go.  (Drag and drop an element to a location and then set it to relative positioning with paramenters for example).
