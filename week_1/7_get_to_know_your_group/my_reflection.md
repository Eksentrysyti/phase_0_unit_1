## 7. [Getting to know your group](7_get_to_know_your_group/readme.md)

Hi Everyone,

I'm Steven Leu from Cupertino, CA.  I live basically down the street from Apple's HQ.  Lots of construction nearby for their new HQ complex, traffic's rough.

3 of my favorite sites are:
1. batoto.net (Japanese comic junkie)
2. newegg.com (to get parts for my computer and other electronics needs)
3. google.com (kinda cheating here, but this is my first stop hands down if I need to know something)

Like everyone else, I'm a multimodal learner according to the VARK test.  I learn best by seeing demonstrations and getting hands on experience on something I'm learning.  I'll admit week 1 was really rough on me because so far it's been reading walls of text and trying to build something from it... not my style.

Here's my work (rather rough, but I'll be coming back to refine my work quality in week 2):

Wireframes

Thanks guys, see you in week 2!

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

This was was spent mostly in panic mode as I felt I didn't have a good handle on what is going on.  Although it was stated that a week's worth of work in phase 0 should take 10-15 hours to complete, it took me closer to 30 hours this week to get everything done.  That's on top of an already challenging 50 hour work week and other obligations.  Although I know I'm not the only one in this boat after reading other reflections, I get the feeling that this should not be how it is.

Settling into the rhythm phase 0 shouldn't be this crushingly overwhelming.  I felt there was simply too much content and not enough onboarding support in the first week.  In one week we've learned how to use GitHub repos, Ruby terminals, HTML, CSS and all the other little minor tools to do the projects.  All from tutorials and walls of text.

Hopefully in the coming weeks we can jump into actual coding and less of the "setting up stuff".
