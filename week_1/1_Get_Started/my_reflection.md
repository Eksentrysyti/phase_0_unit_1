## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

The most difficult part in setting up git and GitHub was learning what they were in the first place.  The tricky part was that the instructions to learning git and GitHub were on GitHub itself and it took some time to learn to navigate GitHub.  To use an analogy, the key to the treasure chest was in the chest itself.  Once I was able to access the resources on the DBC Repository, it was smoother simply following the clear instructions and tutorials to set up GitBash, SSH keys, and everything else that led to the writing of this reflection.  The process taught me how to navigate GitHub and the basics of the purpose and basic commands of git.

git is known as a Version Control System (VCS), which is simply a system that tracks changes made by developers to a coding project.  While git is an actual tool, GitHub can be thought of as a community where users can utilize the git tool.  git is currency, GitHub is the market where you can use that currency.

Version control is a system that tracks modifications of software.  Users can make a copy of a specific piece of code, modify it, and send it back without it getting mixed up or confused with the original copy.  Users can use it to "backup" code in case they make mistakes in later versions.  GitHub helps with this process by providing "repositories" where people can openly share projects with one another in a larger community.

Developers use git not only to allow themselves to experiment with code without risking mistakes, but also to be able to collaborate with a vast amount of peers without accidentally breaking someone else's code.  With version control, developers could work on different parts of code without saving over someone else's work.  It makes tremendous sense to me as it allows a project to be worked on in parallel by several developers, rather than serially.  It increases productivity and brings other features that developers would deem useful.

Earlier on, figuring out how git worked didn't make sense to me.  The concept of working space, staging, and committing changes seemed tedious and unnecessary until I realized that the most important function of git was the ability to collaborate with other developers (I had been thinking in terms of error and backup control).  Having changes moved to temporary work spaces until they were ready to be pushed out would be a requirement to make this functionality available.
