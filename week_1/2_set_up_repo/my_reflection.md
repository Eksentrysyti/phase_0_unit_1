## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository, log into GitHub choose the "New repository" option under the "Create New..." tab.  Name the repository and set the options you would like in the repository and choose "Create repository".  Once the repository is created, clone it by using the GitHub desktop app.  After opening the application, click your username on the left side toolbar, find the newly created repository, and choose the "Clone" option to the right.

Open source means that the source code of the project is openly available for anyone to access, copy, modify, and distribute as they please.

Open source sounds like a great concept for those looking to simply create something magnificent without much overhead.  You simply ask the world if anyone would like to help in your endeavor and off you go.  However, without rules and licensing, it can be tricky to reap rewards in terms of recognition and monetary gain.  I would embrace it with caution and plan further ahead in how much control may need to be maintained if it were relevant to my vision for the project.

Licensing is the method by which one may maintain control of open source projects.  Licensing can allow other users permissions to do as they like with the code but still give you ownership and recognition rights (depending on which license was used).  Without it, you would not be able to expect to claim any sort of ownership or credit for work you release to others.

This challenge allowed some practice in controlling repositories in my GitHub account and showed me more on how cloning files from GitHub to local directories worked.  The "aha" moment was seeing the GitHub desktop app clone repositories from GitHub without requiring the use of GitBash.  While later on I would likely become more comfortable using terminal commands to control these actions, having the convenience of the app was reassuring.

The topics in this challenge were relatively simple to understand.  In the future, I would likely read up more on licensing as I'm sure there are far more details in how each type of license works.
