## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

HTML makes sense in that it is a straightforward language to create what you want on a webpage.  It has all the commands and tools needed to format elements, link to outside resources, and anything else you might need.  Currently, it's hard for me to understand how to organize headers to where I might want them on a webpage.

HTML seems good in that it's flexible in what you want to create.  I feel that it isn't good in that it feels rather tedious that you write out what shows on a webpage, while webpages are usually very complex in layout.  It is like painting the Mona Lisa using text instead of a paintbrush.

My "aha" moment was discovering how CSS is used to enhance the presentation of an HTML page.  I had always wondered how website authors could create a theme on a page without having to write out formatting attributes on every same class of elements.

I used the optional resources listed in the repository to gain a better understanding of how to use CSS to present my HTML page.
