## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Design and user experience are items that must be determined before one begins creating a website.  Without a clear objective in how a programmer wants to design a site and how they want a user to experience their website, they would not be able to create an effective website to meet their goals.

While I do think design and user experience are important, it is a topic that I'm not as interested in to spend a lot of time to perfect.  Yet.  I like working on content and functionality before design, but I do see value in working on design and UX if there are resources left over to accomplish it.

My question during this challenge was how much time and effort do real world programmers actually spend on wireframing.  It seemed to me there was a varying degree from anecdotal blogs ranging anywhere from "no effort expended" to "spent most of the time in planning".  Also, I felt a little overwhelmed by the number of options for picking a wireframing tool.  This challenge allowed for paper and pen wireframing and I wondered if that was actually feasible for a real project.

I didn't have too many issues with the concepts, though for this challenge, I wasn't sure how much detail I needed to put into the wireframe, as the site I had chosen were mostly covered in buttons and links and not so much large blocks of content.

Wireframing as a whole is a "trick" to me for planning out a website.  It makes sense to plan out the layout of a site before building it as you now have a map to build it.

I am fairly comfortable with the learning competencies in this challenge, though if I had time I would like to practice wireframing with a tool such as Illustrator (I did my wireframes by sketching them out on my tablet).

I liked examining each of the sites I picked to see how they laid out their content.  Although I'm a regular user to all of these sites, I never paid much attention to exactly where the location of their features were.

I found actually drawing the wireframes tedious, as I don't have any tools I use on a regular basis to work on wireframing.  I had to quickly learn how to use AutoDesk's Sketchbook application to create my drawings.
