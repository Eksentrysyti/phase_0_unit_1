## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned about the difference between the web and the Internet.  Before the lesson, I never knew there was a subtle difference between the two.  the Internet is the network of computers that had been around a lot longer than I thought, and the web is the information-access model that was built on top of it.  I also learned about the role of DNS and how takes a domain name that a user gives it and returns the IP address of the destination.

When setting up the HTML site, it is important to sync the files created locally to the GitHub repository.  As long as you navigate to correct directory, uploaded files will display properly.

Seeing the web page live was exciting, knowing that this was the first step to creating a full fledged web application.

The "aha" moment was creating the index.html file and realizing that I had seen these files on many other sites before.

I have not checked for other resources yet, but will do so in better understanding how to work with html tags over the weekend.
